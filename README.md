# Project Description
This project tries to detect dog breeds from images using CNN. It accepts any user-supplied image as an input. If it is an image of the dog, predicts which breed the dog is, and if it is an image of a human, it predicts resembling dog.

# Analysis
In the dataset, there are 8351 total dog images divided into three parts for training, validation, and test. The training dataset, validation dataset, and testing dataset consist of 6680, 835, and 836 dog images. There is a total of 133 different breeds in the dataset.

# Results
Results of project is discussed in [medium post](https://medium.com/@Lshahbandayeva/how-to-detect-dog-breeds-from-images-using-cnn-bc90eceaa796 "medium post").
